# AuroraCMS

**AuroraCMS** is a next-generation content management system (CMS) built entirely in **JuliaLang**, designed as a modern, scalable replacement for legacy systems like WordPress. It offers flexibility, performance, and modularity for developers and end-users, with a focus on ease of use and extensibility.

## Features

- **Performance-First**: Built with JuliaLang, AuroraCMS takes advantage of Julia's high-performance capabilities.
- **PostgreSQL Support**: Utilizes PostgreSQL for a robust, scalable database layer.
- **Modular Design**: Themes, plugins, and core components are separated for easy customization and scaling.
- **Extensible**: Easily add or modify functionality with a powerful plugin system.
- **Custom Theming**: User-friendly theming system that mirrors the flexibility of WordPress themes.
- **Secure**: Designed with security in mind, taking advantage of Julia's memory safety features.
